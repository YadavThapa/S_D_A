# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The Thomas High School is not satisfied with the School District Analysis report for  9th grade's reading score and math score result. The School Board notifies Maria and Superviser and it shows the evidence of  academice dishonesty. There might be a chances of grade altered for the 9th grade.

## objective of the project
The main objective of the project is to help Maria and supervisor by generating new report with replacing 9th grade's reading score and math score with NaN value and find the new findings for Thomas High School. 

## Result
Followings are the research findings from our Analysis.

### How is the district summary affected?

By comparing before and after including NaN value result, we came to know that the overall passing percentage has slightly dropped down from the 65% to 64.09% and other math_score and reading_score also slightly dropped down from 75% to 73.88% and 86% to 84.65% respectively.

### How is the school summary affected?

By comparing above two school summary result, we came to conclusion that there is no significant changes of school summary result except Thomas High School results.

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

The initial overall passing score for the Thomas High School was 90.94 % with average math score 83.41,average reading score 83.84, % passing Math 93.27, % passing reading 90.94.

After replacing the nith grade's math and reading score, the result got change with overall passing score 65.06 with average math score 83.35, average reading score 83.89, % passing math 66.91, % passing score 69.66. 

## Result after replacing the ninth-grade scores
After the through analysis and comparision analysis of two result, we found the following results as

### Math and reading scores by grade

There are no significant changes in maths and reading score by grade except Thomas High School.

### Scores by school spending

![]https://github.com/YadavThapa/S_D_A/blob/master/School%20Spending%202.PNG

From the analysis of two results, we came to know that the best spending amount is less that $584. As we spend more amount, we get overall low performance. So it is very wise decision to make less spending. 

### Scores by school size

![]https://github.com/YadavThapa/S_D_A/blob/master/Score%20Size%202.PNG

The reserch suggests that overall passing score is better with the smaller the school size. As we have bigger the school size the overall passing score decreases slowly.

### Scores by school type

The overall passing performance from the charter school is far better that district school.

The initial overall passing percentage is 90 with average math score 83.5, reading score 83.90, % math score 94 and % reading score 97.
The final overall passing percentage is dropped to 87 with average score 83.5, reading score 83.9, % math score 90 and % reading score 93.

And ,the overall district school results not found affected after the replacing NaN values.

## Summary
From the Disctrict School Analysis, we have found some following results.
1. There is slight changes in overall passing result but it still has significant changes for the "Thomas High School" because the changed values has less impact to overall performace due to less number.
2. There smaller the school size, better the overall passing result. As the number increases, the overall passing score reduces significantly.
3. As we spend more money it will reduce the overall performance. And it is wise decision to make less spending. etc.
